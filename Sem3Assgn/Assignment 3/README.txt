Q1->
Here, we first take input of the date from user in the dd/mm/yyyy format.
Then we validate the date and month using different criterion and print the calendar.

Q2->
Here, we first take the command line input and store it in an array. 
Then we use if statements to check the first argument and call the corresponding subroutine. The output is calculated and displayed.
Here, input is one of the operations -> add, sub, mul, div, exp followed by integers to do the same operations.

Q3a->
Here we implement a BST by creating a structure of node. It has the functions insert, delete and print nodes.
These functions are called by the menu in the main function. Also newnode function creates a new node that is inserted into the tree.
The nodes added and deleted are integers.

Q3b->
Here we implement an AVL tree by defining a node in a structure. We perform insert, delete and print functions on this tree.
This is done through the menu in the main function.
The following helper functions have been defined:
1. height - gives height of tree
2. max - returns max value between a and b
3. right - rotates the tree to the right
4. left - rotates the tree to the left
5. balance - gives balance factor of the tree
The nodes added and deleted are integers.

Q4->
Here, we make two functions selection and bubble that do selection sort and bubble sort respectively.
Main function contains the menu to run this program.
Here, the elements of the array are integers.
