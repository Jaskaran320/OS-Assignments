Q1->
Here, we first create a double pointer matrix and assign the number of columns to each row. 
Then we populate each cell with a random value through random() function.
In the menu, the user the enters his choice. If he decides to change the matrix then we change the number of columns inside that row.
Then we repopulate that row with new random values.
The elemnets in the matrix are integers.

Q2a->
Here, we make a Linked List implementation. We make a structure with all the parameters that forms the node along with the next pointer. 
This program includes Insert, Delete, Search and Printall functions which perform the corresponding operations.
Here, name and program take string input, and roll number and year are integers.

Q2b->
Here, we make a Doubly Linked List implementation. We make a structure with all the parameters that forms the node along with next and previous pointers. 
This program includes Insert, Delete, Search and Printall functions which perform the corresponding operations.
Here, name and program take string input, and roll number and year are integers.

Q2c->
Here, we implement stack and queue using Linked List. We have implemented push, pop, enqueue, dequeue and print functions.
The node has been defined using a structure. 
Here, elements entered in the stack and queue are integers.

Q3->
Here, we create a void array that contains pointer to add, sub, mul, div and exp functions. 
The functions take integer arguments and return the answer as an int. Then we typecast void and int type and print the answer.
Here, the 2 elements entered are integers.

Q4->
Here, we make two functions selection and bubble that do selection sort and bubble sort respectively.
Main function contains the menu to run this program.
Here, the elements of the array are integers.
