Q1->
In this question we have to read a file and copy it to another.
fileptr1, fileptr2 are 2 file pointers that point to the text files.
Through the while loop, we read and write the files character by character.

Q2->




Q3->
Here, we have to swap 2 integers. We swap it by manipulating the elements using addition and subtraction.
To swap 2 arrays, we utilise the same logic but run it in a loop to execute this at every position of the arrays.
This code will work when the size of the arrays is same.
The logic used to swap is->
a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b
The elements of the array, size of the array as well as the 2 elements are integers.

Q4->
Here we first take input of string using gets function. The first "for" loop is to find out the length of the string.
The second loop runs backwards through the string and prints it. 
Here, the input is string type.

Q5->
Here we have to use binary search on the given array and find the given element. 
"Selection" function sorts the array using selection sort in increasing order.
"bin" function is simple binary search to find the element using l(low), mid and h(high).
The array and variable "x" are unsigned int data types to hold the large values.
The elements to be entered in the array as well as the element to be searched are integers.
